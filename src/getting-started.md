# Getting Started

So you'd like to get started watching media on Pickflix? You're in the right
place!

## What is Pickflix? ‚ùì

It's a self-hosted streaming service powered by free, open-source software! The
core user experience is requesting media via the request portal, waiting for the
request to be fulfilled, and then streaming the request live via the streaming
portal. That's all you need to proceed, but feel free to refer to the
[FAQ](faq.md) for more information.

## Applications

### [Wizarr](https://welcome.pickflix.mov) üîÆ

Wizarr (yes, two r's) handles all user onboarding. Before you can interact with
any other services, you need valid credentials, and Wizarr is how you'll get
them. If you're reading this, you should have already received an invite link
via Wizarr that looks something like <https://welcome.pickflix.mov/i/ABCDEF>.

Remember, Pickflix is an *invitation-only* service! Without this invitation, you
cannot start using Pickflix.

### [Jellyseerr](https://requests.pickflix.mov) üñ•Ô∏è

Jellyseerr (yes, also two r's) is processes all user requests. You can think of
Jellyseerr like IMDB, it's a massive store of metadata about all the world's
media. Just about movie or show to air can be found and requested in Jellyseerr.

### [Jellyfin](https://streaming.pickflix.mov) üçø

Jellyfin is the where you'll go to actually stream media that's been requested
and fulfilled. This is your Netflix--you'll download the app on your phone, tv,
tablet, or whatever else you'd like and start watching.

## Onboarding Procedure üìã

Before proceeding, you should have already received an invite link that looks
something like <https://welcome.pickflix.mov/i/ABCDEF>. If so, press on!

1. Follow your invitation link in the browser

   Paste your link into your favorite browser and follow the instructions given
   to you by Wizarr. When you're done, you should have selected a username,
   entered a password, and joined the Discord for announcements.

2. Make your first request

   In your browser of choice, navigate to <https://requests.pickflix.mov>. When
   prompted, enter the credentials you created in step 1. Once authenticated,
   search for anything you'd like, and click "Request" and finalize the request
   on the following pop up.

   Note at anytime you can navigate back to the piece of media you originally
   requested and monitor its progress.

3. Install Jellyfin

   While that request is being fulfilled, set up your streaming client. The
   process here will change depending on where you'd like to watch your media,
   so refer to [How to use Jellyfin?](faq.md#how-to-use-jellyfin) for more
   information. The easiest way to get started immediatey is to simply stream
   from the browser by navigating to <https://streaming.pickflix.mov>.

   Regardless of your Jellyfin client of choice, you'll authenticate using the
   same credentials created in step 1. Once authenticated, you should be able to
   browse the existing collection of fulfilled requests.

Just like that, you're done! You know how to request media and where to watch
it. Good job! üòé
